Welcome to the Developer Den! 
This is an organisation of passionate and committed developers who want to create cool things together. 

We're inclusive of all and have an active community of programmers, ranging from brand new to professionals.

**Like what you hear? [Join the Discord!](https://developerden.org/discord)**



## Contributing Guidelines

* Anyone is welcome to contribute to existing projects on the org - you don't even have to be in the discord (although this is recommended!)
* Any user who is Tier 4 or above (Levels 30+) can join the organisation as a member. This means you can add your own repositories to the organisation.



### Project Guidelines
* For obvious reasons, **no illegal or NSFW content** is allowed in any repositories created.
* All repositories in the Developer Den organisation **must be open source and use the MIT license**.
* You're also strongly advised to use GitHub Actions and Docker, as this makes deployment very easy. 
* Whilst you are not obligated to maintain any repositories, please be aware that any repositories that do not receive activity in **6 months** will be archived. If you wish to revive a project (you do not have to be the original author), please message a staff member in the Discord server.
